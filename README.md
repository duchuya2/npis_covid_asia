# npis_covid_asia Project

## Description

This repository contains the R code analysis code and results presented in the article entitled "The Effects of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on COVID-19 Epidemic Growth Rate during Pre- and Post-Vaccination Period in Asian Countries" (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031139). The code is organized into different folders for clarity and ease of use. The project includes R scripts, datasets, plots, and result exports.
## How to Use

To regenerate the code and run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the R project file named **December_analysis.Rproj**.
2. Open the R project file using your preferred R development environment.
3. Navigate to the different R markdown files to execute specific parts of the code. (eg. [pre_vac] analysis_Huy_Dec_10.Rmd, [post_vac] preprocessing_Huy_Dec_10.Rmd, ...)

## Folder Structure

- **master:** Contains the main R codes, and R function for the analysis.
- **plot:** Exports generated plots.
- **datasets:** Stores relevant datasets used in the analysis.
- **results:** Holds exported results from the analysis.

Feel free to explore each folder to understand the organization and find the components you need.

# Abstract
There is little knowledge about how the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reduces the COVID-19 infection rate during the period of vaccine rollout. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of NPIs on decreasing the epidemic growth of COVID-19 between before and after the vaccine rollout period among Asian countries. Our ecological study included observations from 30 Asian countries over the 20 weeks of the pre- and post-vaccination period. Data were extracted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and other open databases. Longitudinal analysis was utilized to evaluate the impacts of public health responses and vaccines. The facial covering policy was the most effective intervention in the pre-vaccination period, followed by border control and testing policies. In the post-vaccination period, restrictions on gatherings and public transport closure both play a key role in reducing the epidemic growth rate. Vaccine coverage of 1-5%, 5-10%, 10-30%, and over 30% of the population was linked with an average reduction of 0.12%, 0.32%, 0.31%, and 0.59%, respectively. Our findings support the evidence that besides the vaccine increasingly contributing to pandemic control, the implementation of NPIs also plays a key role.
